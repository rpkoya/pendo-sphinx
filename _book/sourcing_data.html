<h1 id="intro">Introduction </h1>
<p>These <em>Components</em> are used to uploaded data to the <em>Platform</em>.</p>
<p>At high level, the <em>Pendo Platform</em> deals with two types of data: <em>Structured</em> and <em>Unstructured</em>. The <em>Platform</em> allows you to search through and explore any combination of <em>Structured</em> and <em>Unstructured</em> data via a <a href="unified_search.html#top">Unified Search</a>.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-structured-data">Characteristics of Structured Data </h2>
<p>Generally called databases, <em>Structured</em> data first depends on creating a data model &#x2013; a model of the types of business data that will be recorded and how they will be stored, processed and accessed. This includes carefully defining what fields of data will be stored and how that data will be stored:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tables and Fields are defined and named.</li>
<li>Tables are collections of fields.</li>
<li>Fields are composed of specific data types such as numeric, currency, alphabetic, name, date, address.</li>
<li><p>Field characteristics are specified such as the number of decimals stored, if no decimals are stored, number of characteristics in a string field and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restrictions can be added on the data input (number of characters; restricted to certain terms such as Mr., Ms. or Dr. M or F).</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, databases need to be well organized, i.e. <em>Structured</em>, before any data is put in them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When structured data in brought in the <em>Platform</em>, the database terms Table and Fields are replaced with the metadata terms Entities and Attributes.  </p>
<p><a href="sourcing_data.html#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-unstructured-data">Characteristics of Unstructured Data </h2>
<p><em>Unstructured</em> data files often include text, tables and even multimedia content. Examples include e-mail messages, word processing documents, spreadsheets, presentations, webpages and many other kinds of business documents. Note that some of these files may have an internal structures: an email has a To, From, CC,BCC, Date and Body fields. Or a word processing document may have paragraphs and tables.  However, they are still considered <em>Unstructured</em> or <em>Semi-structured</em> because the data they contain doesn&apos;t fit neatly in a database.</p>
<p>Experts estimate that 80 to 90 percent of the data in any organization is <em>Unstructured</em> and the amount of <em>Unstructured</em> data in enterprises is growing significantly &#x2014; often many times faster than <em>Structured</em> databases.</p>
<p>The <em>Platform</em> allows you to search through, explore and extract any combination of <em>Structured</em> and <em>Unstructured</em> data.  </p>
<p><a href="sourcing_data.html#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:</em></strong> <em>Unstructured</em> data can often contain vital information that:</p>
<pre><code>1.  does not exist anywhere else
2.  is needed to compare to data that exists elsewhere
3.  is needed to feed data to an existing system, such as a more complete risk model.
4.  has data that you wish to extract and make into structured data
5.  all of the above
</code></pre><p>The <em>Platform</em> allows for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching the content of any of these files in the same way as searching for anything else on the <em>Pendo Platform</em>. A <em>Unified</em> <em>Search</em> on the <em>Pendo Platform</em> looks through ALL data, unstructured or structured.</li>
<li>Data can be extracted from an unstructured source and made to be structured. As an example, you may have thousands or millions of complex spreadsheets and want to retrieve a few targeted pieces of information from each of these spreadsheets, or a hundreds of PDFs that have tables containing important information. By extracting this information, it can be sent to other systems in the form of a file, database, etc.  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="file-systems-component"><em>Files and Folders</em> Component </h2>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/9f3c44821238c3ebd5068d6dc5ac3cae.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="file-systems-usage">Usage </h3>
<p>This component is a directory management service within the <em>Workspace</em> and is managed by the <em>Platform</em>.<br>You can Create folders (and sub-folders) and then copy files into these folders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Files uploaded here are actual copies of the files, maintaining NO LINK to the original source location.</li>
<li>Folders you create here can be imported from here, automatically creating a <em>Document Set</em> and indexing the data. You do not have to create a <em>Remote Source</em> and then import it.  </li>
<li>Duplicate file detection - when you upload a file with the same name as a file already in the folder, &#x2018;-copy&#x2019; is added to the end of the imported file name.</li>
<li>You can download the files that have been uploaded to a <em>Users&apos;</em> computer.</li>
<li>Data can be &apos;refreshed&apos;. To update a file(s) (perhaps a newer version of the file), just <em>Delete</em> it from the folder and upload the newer version.  As you will see later, Reindexing this &apos;refreshed&apos; or updated <em>Document Set</em> will reimport all files being processed and update the metadata in the <em>Platform</em>.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong>
<strong>The process of &apos;Uploading&apos; is followed by the process of &apos;Importing&apos;.</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Uploading places a copy of the file itself under the control of the <em>Platform</em> but does nothing with the file.  </li>
<li>There is no link between the original source file and the uploaded file. You may delete a file here, and the original file will not be touched.</li>
<li>Importing the files process them, creating metadata and allowing you to visualize download and extract information from these files.  </li>
<li>.zip and .csv files are not yet supported in &#x2018;Files and Folders&#x2019;.  Please continue to Upload them and then Create and Import a Remote Source.</li>
<li>When you export a <em>Workspace</em> you will be able to optionally export the contents of &apos;Files and Folders&apos;, making migration of a <em>Workspace</em> to a different <em>Workspace</em>, even on a different server, potentially much less labor intensive.  <em>Exporting and Importing a Workspace</em> is covered in the <em>Platform Administration Manual</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="sourcing_data.html#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h3 id="file-systems-how-to-use">How To Use </h3>
<p>Click on &apos;Explore&apos; or the words &apos;Files and Folders&apos; on the blue component tile. You will be brought to the main grid.</p>
<h4 id="fs-create-folder">Creating / Deleting Folder </h4>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/1ec3f090dc9243208b86303558f18e47.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When you see the grid initially, only the &apos;Create Folder&apos; and &apos;Refresh&apos; options are available.
Click the &apos;Create&apos; button.  In the popup, provide a name for the folder and click &apos;Create&apos;.  Note that you can create a Folder inside of another Folder.</p>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/b91354a34ee6d6288508cd69c551fb32.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When you highlight a Folder, the &apos;Delete&apos; and &apos;Import&apos; options become available.</p>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/644aef6b3430bfd9c93272bb1b829960.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To Delete a Folder, highlight it and click the Delete option. A popup appears, asking you to verify your command to delete a Folder.  Note that any files or sub-folders that are in that folder will be deleted. This is your chance to change your mind!</p>
<p><strong>HINT:  Highlighting vs. Selecting a Folder.</strong><br>To highlight a Folder, click on the blank space after the Folder Name.
If you click icon in the &apos;Kind&apos; column or if you click on the Folder name, you are selecting the folder instead of highlighting it. Selecting a folder opens that folder and brings you to the next grid down showing you the contents of the Folder.  </p>
<p><a href="sourcing_data.html#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h4 id="fs-upload-file">Uploading / Deleting files </h4>
<p>Clicking of the icon in the &apos;Kind&apos; column or the Folder name  selects the folder and brings you another grid.  </p>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/847ae7b24a3dcc8312c3f782118e701d.png" alt="">
When you first arrive on this grid, only the &apos;Upload Files, &apos;Create Folder&apos;, &apos;Refresh&apos; and &apos;Up to Parent&apos; options are available.
After highlighting a file by clicking anywhere on a row, the &apos;Download&apos; and &apos;Delete&apos; options can be seen.  </p>
<ul>
<li>To Create a sub-folder, click &apos;Create Folder&apos;. The behavior is the same as above.  </li>
<li>To Delete a file, highlight the file and click &apos;Delete&apos;.  </li>
<li>To move back up to the parent folder, click &apos;Up to Parent&apos;.  </li>
<li>To upload one or more files, click &apos;Upload Files&apos;.  You will see the following popup or one very similar, depending on the WEB browser you are using. The <em>Platform</em> currently runs in MS IE 11, MS Edge and Safari.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/b78c59d38ea18da887fe431ce59cdaa0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note the 3 highlighted sections.  </p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to use any file explorer, such as MS Explorer or MAC File Finder, you may do so. Using the standard selection methods for your computer, you may select one or more files and &apos;drag and drop&apos; them to the area that says&apos; Drop File Here&apos;.  </li>
<li>typing in the blank box or clicking the &apos;Browse&apos; button opens up a standard dialogue box, allowing you to move around an find the file or files you wish to upload into the folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is this:</p>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/c1f98d3701522e2deeeab8a3ce8ccb68.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As the warning by the number 1 indicates, this component is limited to uploading 500 files at a time.  You can upload more than 500, just do it 500 files or less increments.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can select to upload, Cancel or Remove and individual file is section 2.
-Section 3 allows you to Upload All, Cancel All or Remove All files from the queue.   </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you start uploading, there is a progress bar for each file as well as a status.  the status will either be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blank - not processed.</li>
<li>A check - all went well  </li>
<li>A X - something went wrong with this file and it is not uploaded.<br>When you are done uploading, click &apos;Up To Parent&apos; so that you can proceed to Import your data.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="sourcing_data.html#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h4 id="fs-import-folder">Importing Folders </h4>
<p>Once you have uploaded files into folder, you will want to Import that data in the folders so that it can be searched and data can be extracted and organized. Select the Folder that has the data you wish to import into the <em>Platform</em> and click <em>Import</em>.
<img src="sourcing_data/1ebd998a47289bc4a8633396c7ab1c3a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You will go  to the Import screen.</p>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/e833f9e5a8715297637e7465c3ecf288.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <em>Platform</em> will:</p>
<ul>
<li>look in the Folder you created</li>
<li>analyze the  files and display them to you sorted by file type. You do not need to have only one file type in the target directory, however you must only select one type of file to be imported at a time.  For instance, if you have both word processing and spreadsheet files, you would select one of the other for any given Import.  Variation of a file type, such as .doc and .docx can be imported at the same time as they are the same mime type.</li>
<li>Import screen details:  <ol>
<li>In Area 1, you may, optionally, enter a filter for the file types you wish, e.g. pdf. This is useful when the destination of the path contains many different types of files.<ol>
<li>In Area 2, you may easily select/deselect all files types that were discovered.</li>
<li>In Area 3, you may select any combination of the file types you wish brought into the <em>Platform</em>, keeping in mind the warings above. Think of .doc and .docx, not .doc and .xls</li>
<li>In Area 4, you may override the <em>Pendo Platform</em> generated <em>Name</em> and or <em>Description</em>. The Name here will be the name of the <em>Document Set</em> that will be created.  The default name appends the word &apos;Folder&apos; to the front of your folder&apos;s name. For example, if the folder name was &apos;Month End Leasing Reports from Acme&apos;, the default Name will be &apos;Folder Month End Leasing Reports from Acme&apos;.   This is meant to help you remember that the source of data for the <em>Document Set</em> was a folder from &apos;Files and Folders&apos;. Hint: you may make the <em>Name</em> user friendly with upper and lower case letters, spaces and special characters like &#x2018;-_ and make the Description useful &#x2013; perhaps describe the data being brought in. For example &#x2018;Loan Collateral spreadsheets from xxx business unit from date 1 through date 2.&#x2019;</li>
<li>When dealing with <em>Unstructured Data</em> or existing <em>Document Sets</em> the <em>Batch Size</em> is the number of files that will be brought into memory at one time.
The ideal batch size depends on both the amount of memory in the server and the type and sizes of data with which you are dealing.  The smaller the individual file sizes and the more memory your server has, the bigger the <em>Batch Size</em> can be.<br>The <em>Grid Size</em> determines the number of simultaneous threads that will be used to process the data.  The ideal size will depend on the number of processors your server has and what else may be running on the server at the same time.
The <em>Platform</em> will look at your entries and validate them, learning more about each specific data set over time.   You will also get notified about <em>Grid</em> and <em>Batch</em> sizes when you <em>Attach A Document Class</em> in order to extract the mapped data to the <em>Target Entity</em>.<br>If the entered numbers are too big, a maximum recommendation will be shown.  You may overwrite the <em>Platform</em> recommendations, but be aware that this increases the chance that the server will crash.</li>
<li>In Area 6, you may select any of the optional import <em>Plugins</em> that have been made available to you. Select only those <em>Plugins</em> that are relevant to the projects being worked on in a particular <em>Workspace.</em> Some <em>Plugins</em> will result in additional space being used and increased Indexing times. You will also be able to change your selections later via the <em>Edit</em> screens for <em>Unstructured Data Sets</em>.
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: When <em>importing</em> <em>Unstructured Data Sets</em>, you must select at least one <em>Plugin</em> that is a <em>Document Builder</em> so that the <em>Indexing</em> will work.</strong> Notice that each Plugin indicates what type of Plugin it is. When in doubt, please contact Client Services. As a backup, you may select <em>Tika Document Builder</em> as you can always change your mind and select a different or additional <em>Document</em> <em>Builder</em> later.</li>
<li>In Area 7, when ready to import data and create metadata, Click the &apos;Create Document Set&apos; button.  </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After the files are imported, you will be brought to the <a href="document-set-class.html#docset-component">Documents Sets Component</a>  </p>

<h2 id="upload-component"><em>Upload</em> Component </h2>
<p><strong>Note:  This component will be phased out and replaced with the Files and Folders component which will have increased capabilities. Note also that all files uploaded must be zipped files.</strong>  </p>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/67f4d822b42ac4d15d0bc7c7b3e17091.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="upload-usage">Usage </h3>
<p>This is where flat files (a.k.a. delimited files) or zipped Word, PDF and Excel files that are accessible from your PC is uploaded into the <em>Platform&apos;s</em> server. This is a required step before theses files can become a Remote Source.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use">How To Use </h3>
<p>Click on the word <em>Explore</em> or <em>Uploads</em> in the <em>Uploads</em> Component. This takes you to the <em>Uploads</em> grid.
<img src="sourcing_data/51dc1a2a09f158fc844cc39f8865e866.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, click on <em>+UPLOAD</em>. This opens the Upload dialogue screen.
<img src="sourcing_data/c3e11237c4b5c6605cec91dfc5cf2d99.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In Area 1, you have a choice of dragging the file(s) you wish to upload and/or clicking the &apos;Choose Files&apos; button and opening a standard selection screen.  If you click <em>Choose File</em>, just navigate to the location of the file, highlight it and click the <em>Open</em> button.</p>
<p>Repeat as needed to select as many files as you wish to upload.
Note that zipped files that contain MS Word, MS Excel and/or PDF files can be uploaded and subsequently processed as a valid file while creating a <em>Data Source</em>.</p>
<p>In Area 2 you will see a list of all the files that will be processed. You may elect to upload, delete (from the queue, not the source file) or cancel an upload that is in progress.</p>
<p>In Area 3, you can upload, delete (from the queue, not the source file) or cancel an upload that is in progress all of the files listed.  </p>
<p><a href="sourcing_data.html#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h2 id="download">Downloading Files </h2>
<p>Any file that was <em>Uploaded</em> can be downloaded to your local PC</p>

<p><a href="sourcing_data.html#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h2 id="replace">Replace a File </h2>
<p>This allows you to replace a previously Uploaded File without deleting.</p>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/7478e6adacf8a10b7d39ce91fe71d786.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You may replace a file that was Uploaded, Imported and made into a Document Set. This process updates the contents of the Document Set without the user having to delete anything or modify mappings of a Document Class.  This may be a &#x2018;refresh&#x2019; or update of the same file or a complete replacement file of a different name. The file must be of the same type as the original, that is if the original files was .csv, then the replacement must be a .csv, if the original was a .zip of Excel files, then the replacement must be a zip of Excel files and so on. The process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a file and make a zip of it.</li>
<li>Upload this file in Uploads.</li>
<li>Create a Remote Source of Type=File using that file.</li>
<li>Import the Remote Source.</li>
<li>Go to Document Sets, Search the new Doc Set and visualize the file.</li>
<li>Go to Uploads.</li>
<li>Select the original Upload by highlighting it and then click the &quot;Replace&quot; button.</li>
<li>Navigate to the new file, click the Replace button.</li>
<li>Go to Document Sets.</li>
<li>Highlight the Document Set in question and click &apos;Reindex Selected&apos;.</li>

<img src="sourcing_data/09331aa4f420f76dd1242232c0ef25fb.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="data-source-usage">Usage </h3>
<p>The <em>Remote Sources Component</em> is currently where all links are made to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Uploaded</em> zip data files such as Word, Excel and PDF.</li>
<li>JDBC compliant databases such as Oracle, SQL.</li>
<li>Files that were placed in a directory on the <em>Platform&apos;s</em> server by your internal staff.  </li>
</ul>
<p>When the <em>Remote Source</em> is <em>Imported</em>, the <em>Platform</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>creates  <em>Full-Text Indexes</em> automatically making all data available for <em>Unified Searching</em>.   </li>
<li>creates all <em>Metadata</em> (<em>Entities, Attributes</em> and <em>Document Sets</em>).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Both structured data (coming from flat files such as .csv files or from any JDBC compliant database such as MYSQL<sup>&#xA9;</sup>, MSSQL<sup>&#xA9;</sup>, Oracle<sup>&#xA9;</sup>, postgres<sup>&#xA9;</sup>, etc.) and unstructured data (PDF<sup>&#xA9;</sup>, MS Excel<sup>&#xA9;</sup>, any MS Office<sup>&#xA9;</sup> files, iWork&#x2019;s, RTF, email, audio, image, etc.) can be brought onto the <em>Platform</em>. If you need support for a file type that is not currently available, please contact Client Services.  </p>
<p>During actual importing of data, you will have the ability to invoke various <em>Plugins</em> that may be useful to your project. You can also invoke these <em>Plugins</em> when <a href="document-set-class.html#docset-indexing-plugins-tab">Editing a <em>Document Set</em> on the <em>Indexing Plugin Tab</em></a>.</p>

<p>A <em>Source</em> is an existing database that is already populated with data, usually from production systems. <em>Source Entities</em> are read-only.</p>
<p>A <em>Target</em> is a newly created database that is empty.  The purpose of <em>Importing</em> and creating such <em>Entities</em> is to provide a place into which mapped data from a <a href="document-set-class.html#classification">_Document Class</a> project will go.  The <em>Entity(ies)</em> will be populated by specified data that originates from any number of  <em>Document Sets</em> comprised of files such as spreadsheets, PDFs, email, etc.  The population of <em>Target Entities</em> and its associated <em>Attributes</em> is part of the functionality of the <a href="document-set-class.html#classification"><em>Document Classes Component</em></a>, the purpose of which is to create structured data from unstructured data.</p>
<p><strong>  3B-D.</strong>  Here you will accept or modify the naming of the metadata for the new <em>Entity</em>.  By default, the <em>New Entity Name</em> is the same as the table name in the existing database. You may override the system generated <em>Entity Name</em>  into something more user friendly by using spaces, upper and lower case and special characters. Both the <em>API Endpoint and the API Endpoint(plural)</em> can be altered. This is for technical people who will be using the <em>Platform APIs</em>. No spaces or special characters are allowed for any endpoint name.  The default for this field is <em>Source</em>.</p>
<p>Remember to do this for every new <em>Entity</em>, not just the first one.  </p>
<p><strong> 3E.</strong> <em>Batch</em> and <em>Grid Size</em>:  You will see a section of the screen that looks like this:  </p>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/a0cbbd46348bc45f1ce316fe244ca5fb.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Batch Size</em> - when dealing with <em>Importing Structured Data</em>, is how many rows of data will be brought into memory at once.  </p>
<p>The ideal <em>Batch Size</em> depends on the amount of memory in the server and the type of data with which you are dealing.  When the <em>Platform</em> loads the rows from an <em>Entity</em> , it is done in a batch and then written back to the index.  If you have 4 million rows with 10 columns, then you may want a big batch size (~1000) to improve performance.  If you have 4 million rows with 999 columns, you want a smaller batch size (~20) or you will risk memory issues.</p>
<p><em>Grid Size</em> - when dealing with <em>Importing Structured Data</em>, is how many simultaneous threads will be used by the server processors to deal with the data. The ideal size depends on the number of processors in your server and what else may be running on the server.</p>
<p>For &apos;Skip headers records&apos;, you may elect to import or ignore header information for <em>Data Source</em> Type=File.   </p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> This sectional allows you to optionally change the <em>New Attribute Name, (Data) Type</em>, add <em>Internal Documentation Notes</em> and change the <em>Attribute API Name</em>.  You may do this for selected or all fields, as desired.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong>  When you are done with the above items, Click the <em>Import All Selected Entities/Attributes</em> button (number 11 in above image).  </p>

<h4 id="jdbcQuery-example">Type=JDBC Query. Example for writing your own SQL to select data for Importing. </h4>
<p>Advanced: If you wish to write your own SQL to control databases and/or fields that are to be imported, you would use this selection. Only the differences in creating a <em>Type=JDBC Data Source</em> are described below. The <em>Create</em> screen and the first tab of the <em>Edit</em> screens are identical except for a place to write the SQL as highlighted below.</p>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/bdc998908a16a608e7aa81be1d465f83.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead of selecting one database and the choosing which tables to import, this option gives you full control of joins, aliasing, field selection, etc.  You must know SQL in order to use this option.</p>
<p>Examples of what you might put in the SQL box:  </p>
<ul>
<li>select <code>*</code> from databaseA a, databaseB b where a.zipcode = b.zipcode  </li>
<li>select <code>*</code> from database1 d JOIN database2 s ON d.stateOrProvCode = s.stateCode;  </li>
<li>select yearOf as y, timeOfDay as t, stateOrProvCode as s, fabricDye as f from database1 where stateOrProvCode like &apos;A%&apos;;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> When you go to <em>Import</em> this <em>Date Source</em>, it is possible that you have selected tables from different databases that have the exact same field names.  You will need to identify these and rename the <em>Attribute Name</em> and <em>API Name</em> so that each <em>Attribute</em> is unique. The <em>Platform</em> will prevent duplicate <em>Attribute</em> naming within a given and <em>Entity</em>.</p>
<p>You may then proceed from <a href="#documentation-tab">Documentation Tab in the above Type=JDBC example</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h4 id="flat-file-example">Type=File. Example of Flat File </h4>
<p>Here we will point out the minor differences when dealing with a flat file instead of a JDBC compliant database. Flat files are single files with data that are delimited in some way such as with commas, pipes, tabs, etc. You would again click <em>Create</em> in the <em>Remote Sources</em> screen as you did above<em>. You will then see the _Create Source</em> screen.</p>
<p>Only the differences in creating a <em>Type= File Data Source</em> are described below. The <em>Create</em> screen and the first tab of the <em>Edit</em> screens are identical.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Highlight the flat file you click <em>Edit.</em><br><img src="sourcing_data/5394917aa37ae5b76407d1874ca55f56.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>After providing a <em>Data</em> <em>Source Name</em>, select <em>Type</em> to be <em>File</em> and specify the data separator (e.g. comma, slash, tab) and a quote delimiter (e.g. &#x2018;or &#x201C;). Click <em>Save</em> when done.<br><img src="sourcing_data/943a62a04b8708a7edc187e4c4c833e5.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>You may then proceed from <a href="#documentation-tab">Documentation Tab in the above JDBC compliant databases example:</a>.  </p>

<h3 id="unstructured-data">Unstructured Data </h3>
<p>The phrase <em>unstructured data</em> usually refers to information that doesn&apos;t reside in a traditional row-column database. This refers such things as PDF<sup>&#xA9;</sup>, MS Excel<sup>&#xA9;</sup>, any MS Office<sup>&#xA9;</sup> files, iWork&#x2019;s, RTF, email, audio, image, etc.  On the <em>Platform</em>, groups of unstructured data files are grouped in <em>Document Sets</em>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h4 id="unstructured-data-set-example">Type=Folder.  Example of Unstructured Data Set </h4>
<p>For the most part, <em>Document Sets</em> work in a very similar workflow as <em>Structured Data</em>, but there are several key differences on the Source/Access tab and in <em>Importing</em>.  </p>
<p><a href="#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h5 id="create-edit">Create / Edit </h5>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/5c41ffb3c689cc3b23d2b33135b2eaaa.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Unstructured</em> data is usually a collection of many files, perhaps of the same type (e.g. PDF files) or a mixture of different file types.</p>
<p>First, give your <em>Document Set</em> a <em>Name</em>, select <em>Folder</em> from the <em>Type</em> drop down and enter the location of the files you wish to import. All the other tabs work the same as above, allowing you to enter lineage, notes and data owner information.  </p>
<p><a href="sourcing_data.html#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h4 id="import-unstructured-data-sets">Import Documents Sets </h4>
<p><img src="sourcing_data/ad95e7b6524e37940eac6e001cd82ec3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Select the data source containing the <em>Document Set</em> data you wish to import.
<img src="sourcing_data/26f8426f8db3b82fdc776db1980db171.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Platform</em> will look at the location of the files and display them to you sorted by file type and show the number of each type of file. You do not need to have only one file type in the target directory, however you must only select one type of file to be imported at a time.  For instance, if you have both word processing and spreadsheet files, you would select one of the other for any given Import.  Variation of a file type, such as .doc and .docx can be imported at the same time as they are the same mime type.<ul>
<li>If there are other file types that you need imported that do not display, please contact Client Services via <a href="https://pendosystems.zendesk.com/" target="_blank">https://pendosystems.zendesk.com</a> and make a request. Hundreds of file types can supported, but not all may have been implemented or configured during your installation. Support of additional file types are done on an &#x2018;as needed&#x2019; basis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Import screen details:  </p>
<ul>
<li>In Area 1, you may, optionally, enter a filter for the file types you wish, e.g. pdf. This is useful when the destination of the path contains many different types of files.</li>
<li>In Area 2, you may easily select/deselect all files types that were discovered.</li>
<li>In Area 3, you may select any combination of the file types you wish brought into the <em>Platform</em>.</li>
<li>In Area 4, you may override the <em>Pendo Platform</em> generated <em>Name, API Endpoint</em> and or <em>Description</em>. Hint &#x2013; make the <em>Name</em> user friendly with upper and lower case letters, spaces and special characters like &#x2018;-_ and make the Description useful &#x2013; perhaps describe the data being brought in. For example &#x2018;Loan Collateral spreadsheets from xxx business unit from date1 through date2.&#x2019;</li>
<li><p>In Area 5, you may select any of the optional import <em>Plugins</em> that have been made available to you. Select only those <em>Plugins</em> that are relevant to the projects being worked on in a particular <em>Workspace.</em> Some <em>Plugins</em> will result in additional space being used and increased Indexing times. You will also be able to change your selections later via the <em>Edit</em> screens for <em>Unstructured Data Sets</em>.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: When <em>importing</em> <em>Unstructured Data Sets</em>, you must select at least one <em>Plugin</em> that is a <em>Document Builder</em> so that the <em>Indexing</em> will work.</strong> Notice that each Plugin indicates what type of Plugin it is. When in doubt, please contact Client Services. As a backup, you may select <em>Tika Document Builder</em> as you can always change your mind and select a different or additional <em>Document</em> <em>Builder</em> later.</p>
</li>
<li>In Area 6, when ready to import data and create metadata, Click the button.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>After the files are imported, you will be brought to the <a href="document-set-class.html#docset-component">Documents Sets Component</a>  </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE 2:</strong>  Please note that the file types that are imported to a <em>Document Set</em> can also be controlled from the <em>Document Set Component</em> itself. See <a href="document-set-class.html#docset-edit-screens">Document Sets, Edit screen</a> for further details.  </p>
