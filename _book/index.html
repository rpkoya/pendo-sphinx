<h1 id="introduction">Introduction </h1>
<p>This manual is meant for general <em>Users</em> of the <em>Pendo Platform</em>, or simply the <em>Platform</em>. It describes the core <em>Components</em> and <em>Plugins</em> in the <em>Platform&apos;s Dynamic Workspaces. Dynamic _Workspaces</em> are used to encapsulate the data and user permissions for any given project. As the name implies, data and users may be added/edited/deleted and manipulated in an ad-hoc fashion within this <em>Workspace</em>.</p>
<p>This and all other manuals are available for download from our <em>Support Portal</em>. Please see <a href="#support-portal">Support Portal</a> below.</p>
<p>The <em>Pendo Platform</em> may be located on the Amazon Cloud or in-house behind your company&#x2019;s firewall.  </p>

<h1 id="administration-overview">Administration Overview </h1>
<p>The <em>Pendo Platform</em> can be seen as being used by three core types of users, each of which is often dealt with by different teams of people within a large organization.  The exact types of users depends on your organization and the licensing agreement in place.</p>
<ol>
<li>A company&apos;s technical infrastructure team would be involved with the installation and configuration of the <em>Platform</em>. This may include initial setup of servers and storage areas, permissioning of same, as well as routine maintenance of the infrastructure used by the <em>Platform</em>.  Routine installation of software releases may also fall in this domain or the next type of user. These people may or may not actually use the platform itself on behalf of the business users, but usually not.</li>
<li>A special kind of <em>User</em>, set up as a <em>Platform Administrator</em>, who is in your company, will need to set up <em>Workspaces, Users, Organizations, Groups and Roles</em>. A separate manual <em>Platform Administration</em>, is available for <em>Platform Administrators</em>.  <em>Users, Groups and Roles</em> may also be setup using your Single Sign ON (SSO) via LDAP and thus be under the control of your specialists in that area.</li>
<li>Business Users who may be Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and having skills ranging from non-technical business experts to data scientists.  These are the users actually providing the business solution via use of the <em>Platform&apos;s</em> capabilities.   </li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h1 id="login-page">Logging in</h1>
<p>You will use a WEB browser to access the <em>Platform</em>. The URL you use will be provided to you by your administrator. The <em>Login Screen</em> will ask for your email and password or, if using LDAP, your SSO.</p>
<p><img src="login/4a05a63455155e950dd45c8bc4f10529.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After you log in, you will land on the <em>Home Page</em>.<br><a href="#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h2 id="platform-home-page"><em>Platform Home Page</em> </h2>
<p><img src="login/cc4afe0818efe86e66cf3e45eb1948c7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <em>Home Page</em> has several sections:</p>
<p>The top window line is common throughout.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the upper left side, the drop down menu lets you go to the <em>Home Page</em> or select a specific a <em>Workspace</em>.</li>
<li>On the upper right side, the drop down menu gives access to the <em>Administration Menu</em>. Depending on your login permissions, the <em>Administration Menu</em> may be limited or not even appear.</li>
</ul>
<p>The middle section of the screen allows you to click on any of the <em>Workspaces</em>. You will only see <em>Workspaces</em> to which you have been granted some level of access. Once you select a <em>Workspace</em>, you will go to the <em>Workspace Home Page</em>.</p>
<p>Usage of the <em>Administration Menu</em> is covered in a separate manual, <em>Pendo Platform Administration</em>.</p>

<h3 id="a-few-definitions">A few definitions </h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data</strong> is provisioned either by uploading it and persisting it on the <em>Pendo Platform</em>, by linking to it or by extracting information and storing it as metadata. Examples of <em>Data</em> include delimited files, both relational and non-relational databases, Spreadsheets, Word Processing Documents, PDFs, etc. The <em>Platform</em> supports flat files, any JDBC compliant database and various types of unstructured data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Metadata</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Entities</em></strong> are a representation of specific structures (e.g. Tables or Row Headers) which store data acquired from various databases or flat files. <em>Entities</em> are made up of a logical collection of <em>Attributes</em>, which represents the fields within the tables or columns found in flat files. For example the implied structure of data within the flat files or one of the tables in a relational database.  There are two different type of <em>Entities</em>, <em>Source</em> and <em>Target</em>. More detail is provided in the sections below.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Document Sets</em></strong> are groups of unstructured data. This refers to pretty much any data not in a database, for example PDFs, Excels<sup>&#xA9;</sup>, Word<sup>&#xA9;</sup>, Google Doc<sup>&#xA9;</sup>, or other files.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="when-to-use-what-a-workspace-overview">When to Use What &#x2013; A <em>Workspace</em> Overview </h1>
<p>When initially using a <strong><em>Workspace</em></strong>, using the <strong><em>Components</em></strong> in sequence is important. In general, start from the bottom and work your way up and move from left to right.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that the <em>Pendo Platform</em> is a toolset.  The exact functional flow and selection of components is dependent on the needs of your project.  Here are a few diagram to help illustrate the core workflow and a few sample use cases with possible workflows indicated.</p>
<p><img src="login/003be89a12f8d2aaf152ae4805cb9c72.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="login/659e557d28d7dc778002f0ac5abbd136.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In other words, the <em>Platform</em> is used to access and organize data needed by the business line from sources previously deemed to difficult or time consuming to work with efficiently.</p>
<p><img src="login/5b068907e160b62ed0807e185b62db31.png" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h2 id="import">File and Folders, Remote Sources and Uploads</h2>
<p>You will need acquire data for any given project.  Depending on your organizations security requirements, it is possible that only certain administrators will be allowed to provision data for any <em>Workspace</em>. The components used are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File and Folders</strong>: This component uploads files into a file management system that is part of the <em>Platform</em>. Folder management, that is creating folders and sub-folders, is supported.</li>
<li><strong>Remote Sources</strong>: This component imports data that is accessed remotely, such as databases. This component is also used to import anything that was <em>Uploaded</em> via the <em>Upload Component</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Uploads</strong>: Uploads is currently used to upload zipped files to the platform&apos;s server.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="note-on-deletion">Note on Deletion </h2>
<p>Currently, if you wish to delete anything, you may first need to delete everything <em>to which that item belongs</em>. For example, to delete a <em>Document Set</em>, you must first delete any <em>Document Classes</em> associated with that <em>Document Set</em>. Cascading deletion that takes care of this automatically and provides appropriate warnings is being introduced gradually.  </p>
<p><a href="#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h2 id="initial-exploration-of-data">Initial Exploration of Data </h2>
<p><strong><em>Unified Search.</em> </strong>As soon as any data is imported and indexed, it may be searched.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the data is structured, importing automatically creates an <strong><em>Entity</em></strong> or many <strong><em>Entities</em></strong> (one per table or flat file) along with many <strong><em>Attributes</em></strong> (one per column for each table). <em>Full-Text Indexes</em> will also be automatically created, allowing both simple and sophisticated searches across all <em>Indexed</em> data on the <em>Pendo Platform</em> as if it were one unified database.            </li>
<li>If the data is unstructured, importing automatically creates <strong><em>Document Sets</em></strong>. <em>Full-Text Indexes</em> will also be automatically created, allowing both simple and sophisticated searches across all <em>Indexed</em> data on the <em>Pendo Platform</em> as if it were one unified database.</li>
<li>During and after import of unstructured data, you can elect to use some combination of <em>Plugins</em>, giving access to core <em>Platform</em> capabilities as well as advanced, optional capabilities. More on this topic can be found in the <a href="sourcing_data.html#data-sources-component">Data Sources Component</a> and <a href="appendix_plugins.html">Appendix &#x2013; Data Plugins</a> sections below.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong><em>Entities</em></strong> component has two main purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to view the structure of the <em>Entities</em> and <em>Attributes</em> that were created when a database or flat file was imported.  Entities created by importing databases are referred to as <strong>Source Entities</strong>.</li>
<li>Allows for the creation and modification of <strong>Target Entities</strong> which are used to store the data that is extracted from <strong>Documents Sets</strong> during a <em>Document Classification</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Document Sets</strong> are collections of unstructured files such as word processing documents, spreadsheets. etc.</p>
<p><strong>Document Classes</strong> allows for the classification of <strong>Document Sets</strong> in order to group them, search and navigate thru them to get to data that you wish to extract and organize.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top of Section</a></p>
<h1 id="known-issues">Known Issues </h1>
<ul>
<li>IE 11 compatibility issues that will be resolved in future release.  These do not affect any production issues.<ul>
<li>In <em>Search</em> screens, <em>Cluster View</em> is not working at all.</li>
<li>In some <em>Searches</em>, the <em>Hits</em> column is not showing or highlighting the text that was found by the <em>Platform</em>. <strong>NOTE</strong>: The row is returned correctly and you may use the <em>Detail View</em> icon (left-most icon on each row)  to review the document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Date/Time fields have two outcomes, depending on the screen you are on. <strong>This is expected behavior, not an issue</strong>.<ul>
<li>In the <em>Document Class Mapping Preview</em> of data or the  <em>Attachment Preview</em> screens, the date and time will be formatted as specified, but will be sorted as string. Remember, this is a preview screen, the data has not yet been transformed and moved to the <em>Target Entity</em>.</li>
<li>After an <em>Attach</em> has been run and if the date mapping is correctly formulated and has been saved to a properly date formatted <em>Attribute</em>, <em>Searches</em> of a <em>Target Entity</em> result in a column where the date data type is respected and true date/time sorting is supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>.zip and .csv files are not supported in the  <em>Files and Folders Component</em>.  Please continue to upload them via the <em>Upload Component</em> and then <em>Create</em> and <em>Import</em> a <em>Remote Source</em>.</li>
<li>Files or folders that have commas in their name are not supported by the <em>Platform</em>.  Please rename any such file or folder before uploading it to the <em>Platform</em>.
_ An exclamation mark at the start of a lookup value is not supported.</li>
<li><em>Text Table Mappings</em> is not currently available for use.</li>
<li>in a <em>Search</em> result, <em>Cluster</em> mode not fully implemented<ul>
<li>The following Cluster sub-options are not working in Word documents: Keywords, Lines, Cell Values and Cell Reference.</li>
<li>Not working in Excel: lines, cell values, cell references.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Double-byte characters are not displaying correctly, thus multi-lingual abilities are not available.  This effects special accents used in many languages and the double-byte characters like Chinese, Arabic, Japanese.  </li>
<li>Importing of PST files results in no content / structured data for that particular Document Set.</li>
</ul>
